# PROGRESS (ROADMAP.md work log)

Started 2026-11-03 (user handed over ROADMAP.md). Older history: NOTES/LOG.md, NOTES/DECISIONS.md.
One-PC testing uses the echo peer ("stand-in"): build/port3479/*.sh; after every test session savecheck.sh --fix,
test save Out, shipped cdmp.ini restored.

## T01 -- Two-PC playtest pack
Plan: list every 2-PC item (joining incl. room code and invite-only, guest loot, shared enemy set, boss cutscene,
final blow, boss death wait, challenges, ending); rewrite docs/tests/PLAYTEST-1.md as numbered tables with
expected result, Pass / Fail boxes and Notes, plus a session record header.
Done: PLAYTEST-1.md rewritten (blocks 0-7, 60 numbered steps). Later tasks append their 2-PC steps there.

## T02 -- Anti-cheat and terms check
Plan: research the game's DRM / anti-cheat / online services; list the in-process vs online pieces; add a start-up
guard (anti-cheat modules in the process, anti-cheat files in the game folder) that keeps every part of Co-op+ off;
dev switch to simulate a hit; README + findings note.
Done: no anti-cheat (Denuvo Anti-Tamper = DRM); server is in-process; online pieces = Steam, Denuvo licence,
cross-save (PA account), sentry/kafka. src/mod/online_guard.* ; guard tripped (dev online_guard_test=winmm.dll):
log 8 lines, nothing installed, message box shown; normal start: "co-op allowed", all hooks as before.
docs/research/online-integrity.md, README "IS IT SAFE?". Note: when tripped the overlay is not installed either, so
the message is a plain Windows box (an anti-cheat could flag the DXGI hook).

## T03 -- Version handshake
Plan: Hello / Welcome carry the game's exe version (protocol 10 -> 11; the reader rejects trailing bytes, so a bump);
ClientSession refuses another mod build or game version on both sides (no Connected, so no spawn / events), with a
message naming both versions and what to update; shown as a game-style notice; [dev] fake_peer_build to test it.
Done: unit tests (Welcome with another build / game refused, host refuses a Hello and still answers with its own
versions, matching Hello connects). In game: ver1/ver2 (fake build 12345678): "Can't play together: ... has Co-op+
build 12345678 on game ?, you have build 2526DEB6 on game 1.0.0.3479. Both install the same Co-op+ zip." as a notice,
no puppet; ver3 (control): connects, puppet spawns. Older (protocol 10) builds are refused by the old protocol check.
Note: the relay (cdmp_peer) announces build 0 / no game version: not compared (dev tool only).

## T04 -- Reconnect and rejoin
Plan: one-PC kill-and-rejoin loop (echo peer killed = the partner crashes; started again = rejoin), with and without
enemy copies; long alt-tab; check one spawn per connection, removal on each loss, no duplicate copies, no stuck UI.
Findings (build/port3479/rejoin_test.sh, alttab_test.sh):
- rejoin1: 5 cycles, game alive, 6 connections = 6 spawns, 6 "Puppet: remove queued" on the 5 s timeouts.
- rejoin2 ([dev] zone_copy_test=1): each loss "13 copies of theirs removed", each reconnect sends 13 new ones (new
  keys), never more: no duplicate enemies.
- alttab1: 40 s in the background (Notepad focused): no timeout, session kept (the game keeps running unfocused).
- The partner's own crash/restart is a new process: clean by construction; Steam / room-code rejoin: PLAYTEST 1.6b-d.
No code change was needed. Notes: the peer in the earlier late1 run timed out the client while the game was paused in
a minigame without focus; normal play does not pause.
- Pushed T01-T04 (ab89c6b..16f0872) to phase-a/local-pc-setup.
- T05 note: at the title screen (save not loaded) a connecting partner spawns nothing and leaves nothing behind (dropin1, 3 connects).
- T05 finding (dropin2): every (re)connect logs spawn -> "nothing from the other player for 8 s; removing their
  character" -> "the other player is back; reloading" -> spawn again, within 2 ms: a silence timer left over from the
  previous session. With a menu open the game holds injected packets, so both spawns land together and the game
  refuses the second ("Actor 생성에 실패했습니다" = actor creation failed); the copy is then missing until the
  "gone from our world; loading it again" check respawns it ~10 s later (self-healing, but a needless double spawn).
- T05 fix: CoopLink::on_reliable (Spawn) now sets last_remote_ms_ (net/coop.cpp). dropin3: map / inventory / pause /
  combat drop-ins = 4 connections, 4 spawns, 3 removals (the 3 leaves), no "actor creation failed"; after each menu
  closes one partner copy stands beside Kliff (screens dropin3-*). In the combat case Kliff was killed by the bandits
  before the peer joined: it joined during the death screen, spawned once, no crash.
- T05 status [~]: menus, title screen (dropin1), save loading (every PEER=1 run), cutscene (late2: peer joined during
  the arm wrestling intro), fight/death verified on one PC; a boss fight needs a boss -> PLAYTEST 1.6e.
