// Co-op+ co-op worlds (user 2026-11-04, "like Elden Ring Seamless Co-op; protect every player's saves"):
//   - your own (solo) saves are only ever used when you play alone;
//   - every friend you play with gets a co-op world of their own, for the host AND the guest: a separate set of save
//     slots (save_io.h), made the first time as a copy of your own slots;
//   - when a co-op session starts, both games switch into their world with that friend; when it ends (the friend
//     stays away), both switch back to their own saves.
// A switch is the game's own way of changing saves: Esc > Others > Title Screen > confirm, the save folder is changed
// while the game sits at the title (nothing is being saved then), then Play (E), which loads the newest save of the
// world, i.e. where you left off with that friend. A countdown notice comes first; keys and clicks are only sent while
// the game window is in front; every step has a timeout and says what went wrong.
