// Piece 2 of host-authoritative enemies: our enemies hit the other player.
// With aggro_set_copy_targetable our enemies attack the other player's copy;
// each blow is a DoFrameEventReq whose target list names the copy, and our
// server, which does not know the copy, computes no damage. So:
//   sender: learns how much each attack hurts from the blows OUR player takes
//           (enemy variant + action hash -> HP lost), and sends a PlayerHit
//           event with that amount (0 when not learnt yet) for every blow on
//           the copy;
//   receiver: applies it to its own player through its own server
//           (VaryStatByAccInputReq), 5% of its max HP when the amount is unknown,
//           and reacts to it like the sender's player did (hits_set_react).
// combate-coop.md §1.3-1.4 (formats), §4.3 (c2).
