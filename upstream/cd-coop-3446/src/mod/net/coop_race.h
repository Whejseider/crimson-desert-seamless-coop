// Co-op+ (roadmap T41): a race to the waypoint, a challenge game ("Race to the waypoint" in the picker).
//
// The finish is the host's map waypoint (right-click on the map), or the guest's when the host has none: both players
// know both waypoints (each one is sent as a pin, coop.cpp), so both pick the same point without a message of its
// own. After 3, 2, 1 the first to come within kFinishM of it (on foot, on a horse, gliding: anything goes) wins; the
// finish time goes to the other player (Activity type 24: u32 round | u32 ms). A new waypoint starts the next round;
// with no waypoint the banner asks for one.
